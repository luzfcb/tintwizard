# What is tintwizard? #

I have created tintwizard to provide an easy way to produce configs for the popular lightweight panel replacement [tint2](http://code.google.com/p/tint2/). By changing appearance settings through an easy to use interface, users will be able to automatically generate a config file for tint2 and apply this to tint2 to preview their design.

# Why are you developing this? #

I really like tint2 and also like to change the appearance of my desktop frequently. This program will make it easier for me to customize the appearance of tint2 and is also a great learning experience for me. By creating and maintaining this project I will be improving my programming skills, consolidating my knowledge of the Python language and getting to learn PyGTK. Hopefully tintwizard will also be of some use to _you_ as well!

# Where can I get it? #
